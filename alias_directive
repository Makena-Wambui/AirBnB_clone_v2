Certainly! You can configure Nginx to serve content from a specific directory using the `alias` directive. Here's how you can update your Nginx configuration to serve the content of `/data/web_static/current/` when accessing `https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static`.

### Steps to Update Nginx Configuration

1. **Edit the Nginx Configuration File**:
   Open your Nginx configuration file. This is usually located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` or `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` depending on your setup.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

2. **Add the Alias Configuration**:
   Find the `server` block in your Nginx configuration file and add a `location` block for `hbnb_static` with the `alias` directive. It should look something like this:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name mydomainname.tech;

       location /hbnb_static {
           alias /data/web_static/current/;
           autoindex off;
       }

       # Other configurations...
   }
   ```

   - The `location /hbnb_static` block tells Nginx to handle requests to `https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static`.
   - The `alias /data/web_static/current/;` directive specifies the directory to serve files from.

3. **Test the Nginx Configuration**:
   Before restarting Nginx, test the configuration to make sure there are no syntax errors.

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

4. **Restart Nginx**:
   If the test is successful, restart Nginx to apply the changes.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Complete Example

Here's a more complete example of what your Nginx configuration might look like:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mydomainname.tech;

    location /hbnb_static {
        alias /data/web_static/current/;
        autoindex off;
    }

    # Other configurations...
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- `server_name mydomainname.tech;`: Replace `mydomainname.tech` with your actual domain name.
- `location /hbnb_static { ... }`: This block handles all requests to `https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static`.
  - `alias /data/web_static/current/;`: Specifies the directory to serve static files from.
  - `autoindex off;`: Disables directory listing.

### Verify

After updating and restarting Nginx, you can verify that the content is served correctly by navigating to `https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static` in your web browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure Nginx to serve content from `/data/web_static/current/` using the `alias` directive.

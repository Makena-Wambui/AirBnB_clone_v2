This script is designed to create a .tgz (tar gzip) archive of
the contents of the web_static folder from AirBnB Clone repository.

date and time to ensure uniqueness.

Imports python's datetime module, which we use to work with date & time.

Imports all functions and classes(*) from Fabric's API.
This is a library used for automating tasks.

The do_pack function will create the archive.
